A weary traveler stumbled upon a hidden garden where every flower sang the memory of the wind that brushed its petals. As night fell, the blossoms harmonized into a lullaby that guided the traveler back to a forgotten path home. When dawn arrived, the garden faded, leaving behind a single golden seed—a promise that wonder always finds a way to return.

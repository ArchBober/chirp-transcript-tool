I rolled out of bed and stared at the ceiling. The alarm was still buzzing, but I hit snooze and let the sunlight creep in. I shuffled to the kitchen, filled the kettle, and watched the coffee brew. The smell hit me hard—rich, bitter, exactly what I needed.

My phone buzzed. A text from my old teacher: “Hey, got your email. Let’s talk.” I felt a rush of relief. I’d been nervous about reaching out, but now it was done.

I grabbed my jacket, locked the door, and stepped onto the street. Cars honked, people hurried past, and the city sounded alive. I walked toward the café where we’d meet, feeling the weight lift off my shoulders. Sometimes a small step—sending a message, taking a breath—makes the whole day feel brighter.
